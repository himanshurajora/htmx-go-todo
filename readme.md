Legends say it is the stack of the future. Then why not give it a try.

- Add Task
- List Task
- Remove Task

That's it.
I think that's enough to get started. Maybe we can improve it later. But there are already 10 million ToDo apps and it won't help at all after having a new one (With even less features).
